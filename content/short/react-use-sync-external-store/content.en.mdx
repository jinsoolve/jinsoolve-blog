## tl;dr

There are several libraries out there that help you manage state in React without using React's internal hooks, such as `useState` and `useReducer`.
hooks inside React, such as `useState` and `useReducer`. These include redux, recoil, jotai, xtsate, zustand, rect query... to name a few.

Simply put, `useSyncExternalStore` allows you to synchronize a store that doesn't rely on React (the libraries listed above) and track changes via `useState` and `useEffect`,
and synchronize them with React's re-rendering through the setter of `useState`.

## useSyncExternalStore

The [official documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore#usesyncexternalstore) is located here.
Intuitively, if you break it down, it's use + sync external store, a hook to sync with an external store (use).

```tsx
const snapshot = useSyncExternalStore(
  subscribe,
  getSnapshot,
  getServerSnapshot
);
```

So if you have a stateful library that doesn't have a React dependency, or an external store that doesn't have a React dependency and your rendering logic might be
It's a hook that allows you to connect to an external store that might have some issues and get on top of React's re-rendering system.

So how is it implemented internally? The implementation code is located [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/dddfe688206dafa5646550d351eb9a8e9c53654a/packages/use-sync-external-store/src/useSyncExternalStoreShimClient.js).

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import is from 'shared/objectIs';

// Intentionally not using named imports because Rollup uses dynamic
// dispatch for CommonJS interop named imports.
const {useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useDebugValue} = React;

let didWarnOld18Alpha = false;
let didWarnUncachedGetSnapshot = false;

// Disclaimer: This shim breaks many of the rules of React, and only works
// because of a very particular set of implementation details and assumptions
// -- change any one of them and it will break. The most important assumption
// is that updates are always synchronous, because concurrent rendering is
// only available in versions of React that also have a built-in
// useSyncExternalStore API. And we only use this shim when the built-in API
// does not exist.
//
// Do not assume that the clever hacks used by this hook also work in general.
// The point of this shim is to replace the need for hacks by other libraries.
export function useSyncExternalStore<T>(
  subscribe: (() => void) => () => void,
  getSnapshot: () => T,
  // Note: The shim does not use getServerSnapshot, because pre-18 versions of
  // React do not expose a way to check if we're hydrating. So users of the shim
  // will need to track that themselves and return the correct value
  // from `getSnapshot`.
  getServerSnapshot?: () => T,
): T {
  if (__DEV__) {
    if (!didWarnOld18Alpha) {
      if (React.startTransition !== undefined) {
        didWarnOld18Alpha = true;
        console.error(
          'You are using an outdated, pre-release alpha of React 18 that ' +
            'does not support useSyncExternalStore. The ' +
            'use-sync-external-store shim will not work correctly. Upgrade ' +
            'to a newer pre-release.',
        );
      }
    }
  }

  // Read the current snapshot from the store on every render. Again, this
  // breaks the rules of React, and only works here because of specific
  // implementation details, most importantly that updates are
  // always synchronous.
  const value = getSnapshot();
  if (__DEV__) {
    if (!didWarnUncachedGetSnapshot) {
      const cachedValue = getSnapshot();
      if (!is(value, cachedValue)) {
        console.error(
          'The result of getSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop',
        );
        didWarnUncachedGetSnapshot = true;
      }
    }
  }

  // Because updates are synchronous, we don't queue them. Instead we force a
  // re-render whenever the subscribed state changes by updating an some
  // arbitrary useState hook. Then, during render, we call getSnapshot to read
  // the current value.
  //
  // Because we don't actually use the state returned by the useState hook, we
  // can save a bit of memory by storing other stuff in that slot.
  //
  // To implement the early bailout, we need to track some things on a mutable
  // object. Usually, we would put that in a useRef hook, but we can stash it in
  // our useState hook instead.
  //
  // To force a re-render, we call forceUpdate({inst}). That works because the
  // new object always fails an equality check.
  const [{inst}, forceUpdate] = useState({inst: {value, getSnapshot}});

  // Track the latest getSnapshot function with a ref. This needs to be updated
  // in the layout phase so we can access it during the tearing check that
  // happens on subscribe.
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    inst.value = value;
    inst.getSnapshot = getSnapshot;

    // Whenever getSnapshot or subscribe changes, we need to check in the
    // commit phase if there was an interleaved mutation. In concurrent mode
    // this can happen all the time, but even in synchronous mode, an earlier
    // effect may have mutated the store.
    if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
      // Force a re-render.
      forceUpdate({inst});
    }
  }, [subscribe, value, getSnapshot]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check for changes right before subscribing. Subsequent changes will be
    // detected in the subscription handler.
    if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
      // Force a re-render.
      forceUpdate({inst});
    }
    const handleStoreChange = () => {
      // TODO: Because there is no cross-renderer API for batching updates, it's
      // up to the consumer of this library to wrap their subscription event
      // with unstable_batchedUpdates. Should we try to detect when this isn't
      // the case and print a warning in development?

      // The store changed. Check if the snapshot changed since the last time we
      // read from the store.
      if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
        // Force a re-render.
        forceUpdate({inst});
      }
    };
    // Subscribe to the store and return a clean-up function.
    return subscribe(handleStoreChange);
  }, [subscribe]);

  useDebugValue(value);
  return value;
}

function checkIfSnapshotChanged<T>(inst: {
  value: T,
  getSnapshot: () => T,
}): boolean {
  const latestGetSnapshot = inst.getSnapshot;
  const prevValue = inst.value;
  try {
    const nextValue = latestGetSnapshot();
    return !is(prevValue, nextValue);
  } catch (error) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

The code looks a bit long, but if you remove the code from the **DEV** environment and remove all comments, the code is not that long.

```ts
export function useSyncExternalStore<T>(
  subscribe: (() => void) => () => void,
  getSnapshot: () => T,
  getServerSnapshot?: () => T,
): T {
  const value = getSnapshot();
  const [{inst}, forceUpdate] = useState({inst: {value, getSnapshot}});

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    inst.value = value;
    inst.getSnapshot = getSnapshot;

    if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
      forceUpdate({inst});
    }
  }, [subscribe, value, getSnapshot]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
      forceUpdate({inst});
    }
    const handleStoreChange = () => {
      if (checkIfSnapshotChanged(inst)) {
        forceUpdate({inst});
      }
    };
    return subscribe(handleStoreChange);
  }, [subscribe]);

  useDebugValue(value);
  return value;
}
```

What do you think, it's not that long, right?

The main logic is to get the snapshot value via the `getSnapshot` function from the user,
If that snapshot has changed, the only logic is to force an update and re-render.

The `checkIfSnapshotChanged` function is implemented as follows.

```tsx
function checkIfSnapshotChanged<T>(inst: {
  value: T;
  getSnapshot: () => T;
}): boolean {
  const latestGetSnapshot = inst.getSnapshot;
  const prevValue = inst.value;
  try {
    const nextValue = latestGetSnapshot();
    return !is(prevValue, nextValue);
  } catch (error) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

This function checks if the snapshot has changed in the `useSyncExternalStore` hook,
It is used to force a re-render when the snapshot has changed.
If a change is detected, the re-render is forced via `forceUpdate`.

So `useSyncExternalStore` is used for external stores implemented without using React's internal hooks.
external store implemented without using React's internal hooks to get on React's rendering system.
