## flex-start vs baseline

![Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34606879/whats-the-difference-between-flex-start-and-baseline](./1.png)

## Summary

- align-items: flex-start aligns the child elements at the start of the flex box's cross axis.
- align-items: baseline` aligns the child elements to the text baseline of the flex box's cross axis.
  - Use this when you need to list the text of the children in a flex box based on their text.
  - Somehow, I think it might be harder to debug the CSS because it creates one more deps. (parent - child - child's text)
